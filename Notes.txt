File chooser tutorial:

Things to do still:
- Check interface matches
- Add kick functionality
- Add picture stuff
--- Can broadcast picture
--- Or send to specific client
- Rename methods
- Tell clients when someone has left the chat


RANDOM CHAT APP IDEAS:
- Maybe store previous messages, that the client can request to see
- Add a status
- Ignore a user (different to kicking a user)
